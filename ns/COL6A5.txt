Phenome-wide association is a novel reverse genetic strategy to analyze
genome-to-phenome relations in human clinical cohorts. Here we test this approach
using a large murine population segregating for ∼5 million sequence variants, and
we compare our results to those extracted from a matched analysis of gene
variants in a large human cohort. For the mouse cohort, we amassed a deep and
broad open-access phenome consisting of ∼4,500 metabolic, physiological,
pharmacological and behavioural traits, and more than 90 independent expression
quantitative trait locus (QTL), transcriptome, proteome, metagenome and
metabolome data sets--by far the largest coherent phenome for any experimental
cohort (www.genenetwork.org). We tested downstream effects of subsets of variants
and discovered several novel associations, including a missense mutation in
fumarate hydratase that controls variation in the mitochondrial unfolded protein 
response in both mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans, and missense mutations in
Col6a5 that underlies variation in bone mineral density in both mouse and human.

Both genetic and environmental factors are important for the development of
allergic diseases. However, a detailed understanding of how such factors act
together is lacking. To elucidate the interplay between genetic and environmental
factors in allergic diseases, we used a novel bioinformatics approach that
combines feature selection and machine learning. In two materials, PARSIFAL (a
European cross-sectional study of 3113 children) and BAMSE (a Swedish
birth-cohort including 2033 children), genetic variants as well as environmental 
and lifestyle factors were evaluated for their contribution to allergic
phenotypes. Monte Carlo feature selection and rule based models were used to
identify and rank rules describing how combinations of genetic and environmental 
factors affect the risk of allergic diseases. Novel interactions between genes
were suggested and replicated, such as between ORMDL3 and RORA, where certain
genotype combinations gave odds ratios for current asthma of 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.6)
and 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.0) in the BAMSE and PARSIFAL children, respectively.
Several combinations of environmental factors appeared to be important for the
development of allergic disease in children. For example, use of baby formula and
antibiotics early in life was associated with an odds ratio of 7.4 (95% CI
4.5-12.0) of developing asthma. Furthermore, genetic variants together with
environmental factors seemed to play a role for allergic diseases, such as the
use of antibiotics early in life and COL29A1 variants for asthma, and farm living
and NPSR1 variants for allergic eczema. Overall, combinations of environmental
and life style factors appeared more frequently in the models than combinations
solely involving genes. In conclusion, a new bioinformatics approach is described
for analyzing complex data, including extensive genetic and environmental
information. Interactions identified with this approach could provide useful
hints for further in-depth studies of etiological mechanisms and may also
strengthen the basis for risk assessment and prevention.
