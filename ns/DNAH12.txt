Molecular genetic testing informs diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment for
patients and their family members. Recent advances in low-cost, high-throughput
DNA sequencing and computing technologies have enabled the rapid expansion of
genetic test content, resulting in dramatically increased numbers of DNA variants
identified per test. To address this challenge, our laboratory has developed a
systematic approach to thorough and efficient assessments of variants for
pathogenicity determination. We first search for existing data in publications
and databases including internal, collaborative and public resources. We then
perform full evidence-based assessments through statistical analyses of
observations in the general population and disease cohorts, evaluation of
experimental data from in vivo or in vitro studies, and computational predictions
of potential impacts of each variant. Finally, we weigh all evidence to reach an 
overall conclusion on the potential for each variant to be disease causing. In
this report, we highlight the principles of variant assessment, address the
caveats and pitfalls, and provide examples to illustrate the process. By sharing 
our experience and providing a framework for variant assessment, including access
to a freely available customizable tool, we hope to help move towards
standardized and consistent approaches to variant assessment.

OBJECTIVE: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for Crohn's
disease (CD) have not fully explained the heritability of CD, suggesting that
additional loci are yet to be found and that the known loci may contain high
effect rare risk variants that have thus far gone undetected by GWAS. While the
cost of deep sequencing remains too high to analyse many samples, targeted
sequencing of pooled DNA samples allows the efficient and cost effective capture 
of all variations in a target region.
DESIGN: We performed pooled sequencing in 500 Korean CD cases and 1000 controls
to evaluate the coding exon and 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 131 CD
associated genes. The identified genetic variants were validated using genotyping
in an independent set of 500 CD cases and 1000 controls.
RESULTS: Pooled sequencing identified 30 common/low single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) in 12 genes and 3 rare SNVs in 3 genes. Our results confirmed a
significant association of CD with the following previously reported risk loci:
rs3810936 in TNFSF15 (OR=1.83, p<2.2×10(-16)), rs76418789 in IL23R (OR=0.47,
p=1.14×10(-8)) and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 (OR=1.30, p=5.28×10(-6)). In addition,
novel loci were identified in TNFSF8 (rs3181374, OR=1.53, p=1.03×10(-14)), BTNL2 
(rs28362680, OR=1.47, p=9.67×10(-11)), HLA-DQA2 (rs3208181, OR=1.36,
p=4.66×10(-6)), STAT3 (rs1053004, OR=1.29, p=2.07×10(-5)), NFKBIA (rs2273650,
OR=0.80, p=3.93×10(-4)), NKX2-3 (rs888208, OR=0.82, p=6.37×10(-4)) and DNAH12
(rs4462937, OR=1.13, p=3.17×10(-2)). A novel rare SNV, rs200735402 in CARD9, was 
shown to have a protective effect (OR=0.09, p=5.28×10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep resequencing of 131 CD associated genes confirmed 3
reported risk loci and identified 8 novel risk loci for CD in Koreans, providing 
new insights into the genetic architecture of CD.
