Leukocyte telomere length is believed to measure cellular aging in humans, and
short leukocyte telomere length is associated with increased risks of late onset 
diseases, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, etc. Many studies have
shown that leukocyte telomere length is a heritable trait, and several candidate 
genes have been identified, including TERT, TERC, OBFC1, and CTC1. Unlike most
studies that have focused on genetic causes of chronic diseases such as heart
disease and diabetes in relation to leukocyte telomere length, the present study 
examined the genome to identify variants that may contribute to variation in
leukocyte telomere length among families with exceptional longevity. From the
genome wide association analysis in 4,289 LLFS participants, we identified a
novel intergenic SNP rs7680468 located near PAPSS1 and DKK2 on 4q25 (p = 4.7E-8).
From our linkage analysis, we identified two additional novel loci with HLOD
scores exceeding three, including 4.77 for 17q23.2, and 4.36 for 10q11.21. These 
two loci harbor a number of novel candidate genes with SNPs, and our gene-wise
association analysis identified multiple genes, including DCAF7, POLG2, CEP95,
and SMURF2 at 17q23.2; and RASGEF1A, HNRNPF, ANF487, CSTF2T, and PRKG1 at
10q11.21. Among these genes, multiple SNPs were associated with leukocyte
telomere length, but the strongest association was observed with one contiguous
haplotype in CEP95 and SMURF2. We also show that three previously reported
genes-TERC, MYNN, and OBFC1-were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere
length at p empirical < 0.05.
